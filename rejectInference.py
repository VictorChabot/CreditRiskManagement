"""
The objective of the program is to implement reject infering methods
In credit risk modeling we predict the probability of default on all the accepted loan.
Since we observe default only on accepted loan, we have a selection bias in our training dataset.
To correct that selection bias, reject infering methods assign a target variable parts or all the rejected loan.
